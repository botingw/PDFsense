files under ./example folder are example configure files, a test observable data file (quick_data_example), and a test PDF set (CT14HERA2NNLO).
to run example files, just copy configure files under ./example to the ./bin directory and run scripts (read tutorial 4.4. SOP of Plotting Figures of New Experiments):

1. run fxQsamept_corr.nb (or .m by math -script fxQsamept_corr.m)
2. run run_v3.nb (or .m by math -script run_v3.m)
3. go to ./quick_data/ and ./plots/Jobs/457/ to see output data files and figure files 

note:
To know how to run, read tutorial 4.1 (mathematicav23_eg_program_note_v8.pdf) Run Step By Step
To know what's difference among executable files, read tutorial 4.3. Input And Output Of Executables
For this eg version, read tutorial Appendix B
run_loopexpts_v3.nb could generate figures of Expt IDs in "config1.txt" seperately in subdirectories with folder name == their own Expt ID
expts_info_v4.nb and code_tutorial.nb are used to see information of observable data and tutorial of functions in the program
