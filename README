files under ./example folder are example configure files, a test observable data file (quick_data_example), and a test PDF set (CT14HERA2NNLO).
to run example files, just copy configure files under ./example to the ./bin directory and run scripts (read tutorial 4.4. SOP of Plotting Figures of New Experiments):

1. run fxQsamept_corr_v2.nb (or .m by math -script fxQsamept_corr_v2.m)
2. run run_v4.nb (or .m by math -script run_v4.m)
3. go to ./quick_data/ and ./plots/Jobs/ to see output data files and figure files 

Under ./quick, there are default 3 plotted data: CT14NNLO, CH14HERA2NNLO, and CT14HERA2_no_jet,
To use them to plot, just set in the config1.txt as their names, e.g.
......
PDF set: CT14HERA2NNLO
......


note:
To know how to run, read tutorial 4.1 (mathematicav23_eg_program_note_v8.pdf) Run Step By Step
To know what's difference among executable files, read tutorial 4.3. Input And Output Of Executables
code_tutorial.nb is used to run tutorial of functions in the program so that users can know how to functions in the package work
under ./bin/tools are some tools for advanced analysis,
a. make_info_table_v2.nb and read_info_table_v2_TH_BT_v2.nb could analyze the info files of the outputs of run_v4.nb(.m) (e.g. corr_info-1__samept_info.txt),
the output are tables of statistical quantities for the data corresponding to output plots with the .tex format
b. plotted_data_combine_test.nb could merge data in the database (./quick_data)

# How to run the code           #
#################################

One could run the GUI interface, the Mathematica scripts (.m executables), or Mathematica notebooks (.nb executables)  
to implement the PDFsense. the GUI interface provides a user-friendly way to run the package. The script and notebook
files enable users to run the package more flexible and to run more result in a run.

Running the GUI interface:
a. ./XQPLOTTER 
b. select PDF set, experiments, variable to be presented, and the demonstration of plots 
(x, mu range, the color palette of the value range, etc)
c. click submit and output plots will pop out

Running the script and notebook:

a. setting config1.txt file under ./bin:
One could set up the input data, variables presented in plots, and the demonstration of plots in config1.txt.

In the config1.txt, #PDF set, # Figures to plot, # Experiments to include, #Functions to use in correlations, 
#User function parameters are for setup of the input data.
#x-Q figure parameters, #Histogram figure parameters, #in plots, #highlight mode, #data point size are for 
setup of how figures look like 

input data are in ./quick_data, output plots will be in ./plots/Jobs,
In the config1.txt, "#PDF set..." set the input data (output of fxQsamept_corr_v2.nb or .m)
"# Experiments..." select the experiments (represented by ID numbers) to be plotted,
if a selected experiment is not in the input data, the plots would not contain it's information. 

The user option in "#Functions (F)..." enables users (when it's Flag = 1) to create the customized function Func in 
correlations Corr(ri, Func) and sensitivity Sens(ri, Func). 

"#Axes ranges..." and the settings below it are for the demonstration of plots 

b. run the Mathematica script/notebook:
first, go to ./bin directory, then 
for the script: go to ./bin directory, then commandline math -script run_v4.m 
for the notebook: open run_v4.nb and implement the code

c. output
The output is in ./plots/Jobs,
The folder name is controled by "#Job ID..." in config1.txt

# generating the data for plots #
#################################
If one don't want to only use the the data in our database (data default in ./quick_data), one could also generate the
data by the Mathematica scripts (.m executables), or Mathematica notebooks.
The input data he need is the analyzed data from CTEQ code: .pds file and .dta file 
.pds contains the PDF info and .dta contains analyzed data of experiments and the selected PDF set

a. edit the savedata_config.txt
PDF set Dir, PDF method, Expt ID List, datalis file for input setting
Correlation Path & Correlation File for output setting
If output setting is default, the data would be saved in ./quick_data
