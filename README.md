This program is for studying the strength of constraints on Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) imposed by experimental data. 
The approach, sensitivity mapping, is encoding the sensitivity as the correlation between Hessian error ensembles of experimental residuals and PDFs f(x, &mu;), where (x, &mu;) indicates the structure of nucleon. It is published in ArXiv: 1803.02777.
