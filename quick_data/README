This version select the bin center value for kinematical quantities of expt data point to calculate the (x,Q) specifying that point.

includes: rapidity (y) of jet processes and ttbar
Pt/mll of ID = 247, 252, 253, 254, 255  

there are better ways to estimate the kinematical quantities:
select the point in the bin that is closer to the peak of the spectrum.
e.g. for W/Z processes, the peak of mll is 80/90 GeV,
so for the ranges in bins, the side that is closer to the peak have stronger weight.
Therefore, we can choose the points closer to the peak rather than just the points at the centers of the bins.
