for jet/ttbar processes, only select (x,Q) with 10^-10< x1, x2 < 1

248 break down by large rapidity
no ID = 252~255 

20171209 renew: add 252~255 for CT14HERA2NNLO

20180101: add CT14HERA2_no_jet, no 247, 254, 255, 191~194
20180103: update 247 to CT14HERA2_no_jet

20180412: this update includes
a. for making the ranking table in the paper, modify the way to discard specified points: if one of two specified points has x>1, only discard that point,
impact: VBP, JP, TTbar, the main impact is in jet data
b. 542, 545 .dta data redo: the original version does not concern the correlated experimental error so that residuals of 542 and 545 data are large, 
resulting in some tension with other data

p.s. the CT14NNLO is not finished yet

20180417: replace LHeC 191~194 by the version with uncor errors considered 
20180422: add the CT14NNLO PDFset
